# Ultimate Windows & MacOS Keyboard Layout for Programming, Engineering and Science with Umlauts, Greek and Math Symbols

based on the US International Keyboard and inspired by the MacOS Alt-Keys,
with AltGr-Keys for Greek and Math symbols. 
optimal for Coding and writing Engineering and Science related things.
(still usable for Germans with äöüß etc.).
Made with the MS Keyboard Layout Creator. 
The Source File is in included so you can change it yourself. 
But installing the MS Keyb Layout Cr. requires older .NET Runtimes on Win10.

    third row : γξδ√∫ημ≤≥÷
